 One alleged tablet thief in South Africa may be the newest addition to our list of dumb criminals caught through Facebook. James and Barbara McCall experienced a recent spate of burglaries at their guesthouse in Hillcrest, KwaZula-Natal, and found their Samsung tablet missing after the latest incident, South Africa-based IOL News reported. Upon discovering the theft, McCall changed the login passwords for his social networks; that's when he saw a man's photo had been uploaded to his wife's Facebook page. He said he believes the man is one of the burglars. "He probably did not realize he was doing it. Usually you never log off from a tablet, so it could have happened quite quickly."  McCall handed the photo over to police, but so far, no arrests have been made. Check out the video, above, for more.
