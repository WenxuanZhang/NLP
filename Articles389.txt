Several big moments brought attendees at the Golden Globes to their feet Sunday night.  Former U.S. President Bill Clinton strolled on stage for a surprise appearance — making jaws drop — to introduce the montage for presidential flick, Lincoln. "Wow, what an exciting special guest ... That was Hillary Clinton's husband," co-host Amy Poehler, alongside Tina Fey, jokingly said after Clinton's appearance. Ben Affleck, who was left off the Best Director nominees list for the Oscars, took home top honors for Best Director. He and his Argo comrades also won for Best Drama.  Meanwhile, some celebrities referenced viral web entities. Hollywood Foreign Press Association President Aida Takla-O'Reilly channeled her inner Carly Rae Jepsen by saying, "Allow me to say three little words to Bradley Cooper: Call me maybe?" And during Jodie Foster's head-scratching speech for her Lifetime Achievement Award, the actress quipped, "I'm not Honey Boo Boo Child." On Twitter, people sent 3.6 million tweets during the red carpet and broadcast, pushing the total in 24 hours to 4.2 million. These were the most-tweeted moments: 1) Jennifer Lawrence wins  Best Actress (comedy or musical) for Silver Linings Playbook with 19,886 tweets per minute; 2) Anne Hathaway wins Best Supporting Actress (comedy or musical) for Les Miserables with 19,695 TPM; and 3) Clinton introduces Lincoln with 18,290 TPM.

 The televised 70th Golden Globe Awards experienced several technical glitches, too. Salma Hayek and Paul Rudd fell victim to a teleprompter malfunction, preventing them from properly introducing the Best TV Drama Series nominees, while the sound cut out multiple times during Foster's speech.
