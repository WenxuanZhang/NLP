Business collaboration, productivity and process apps went mobile in a big way in 2012, and this upward trend is expected to continue through 2017. In a new report, research firm Strategy Analytics says more than 200 million mobile workers will be using mobile business apps in 2013. It predicts that the revenue associated with these mobile business apps will increase from $25 billion in 2012 to almost $50 billion by the end of 2017. "The consumer mobile experience has taught mobile workers to expect, even demand, access to information and applications from anywhere using mobile devices," said Mark Levitt, director of business cloud strategies at Strategy Analytics.  "Mobile workers have moved beyond just mobile email and messaging to include other collaboration apps such as conferencing, productivity apps such as content authoring, and business process apps such as CRM and even ERP." "The business imperative for workers to be productive while on the way to, from and at customer and other remote work sites is driving the rapid mobilization of business apps,” added Andrew Brown, the firm’s director of enterprise research. “Growth in secure application distribution through mobile device and application management (MDM and MAM) and Enterprise App Stores is helping to allay security fears and ensure compliance.” Photo courtesy of Flickr, mikecogh
