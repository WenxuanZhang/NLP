NBA star Kevin Durant, one of the sports world's renowned good guys, has recently come under a bit of scrutiny for a fouler-than-normal mouth and surlier-than-standard on-court demeanor.  His grandma, for one, doesn't approve.  That's according to a text message she sent him after his team, Oklahoma City Thunder, beat the Phoenix Suns Monday night. In the message, she congratulated him on the win, but tempered her praise with a side of scolding: "Kev kev stop cussing so much they be showing u when u do." Durant shared a screenshot of the message — and his reply — with his 960,000 Instagram followers on Tuesday:  The photo came with an appropriate enough caption: "sorry grandma lol." But the message did seem to go over well with fans — at the time of writing, more than 63,000 people had Insta-liked the photo.
