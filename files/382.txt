Diane von Furstenberg and VSP, the largest non-profit vision benefits company, are working together to give free eye care using a Pinterest campaign.  VSP will donate up to 1,000 certificates for eye exams and glasses — one per repin from its #PinToGiveAndGet board — to youth in need through the New York City Mission Society, a charity chosen by DVF. Each giveaway is valued at $385, which will total up to a $385,000 donation. "We've been following what other brands are doing on Pinterest and we saw a lot of brands dabling in Pin It To Win It and Pin To Give," Julie Berge, VSP senior PR specialist, told Mashable. "Being a not-for-profit, and our ability to provide eye exams, we thought Pinterest would be a fun platform to experiment with, and it's a space we thought we could make a big impact." There's something in it for you if you repin from the #PinToGiveAndGet board besides doing good. Participants will be entered to receive one pair of DVF sunglasses each week and one $500 gift card to be used on dvf.com. The campaign, which launched last month, will run through Jan. 31.
