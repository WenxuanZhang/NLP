 For the first time, smartphones trump tablets when it comes to data consumption, a new study reveals. Conducted by mobile analytics firm Arieso, the report suggests that smartphone users now "consistently consume" more mobile data than tablet users despite the latter's market expansion. At the top of the list are iPhone 5 owners — the "hungriest" data consumers — who demand 50% more than iPhone 4S users and four times as much as iPhone 3G users. Overall, mobile data consumption is skyrocketing, pushed by "new devices and richer content," according to a release. "Extreme users are beginning to move to new LTE networks, but there is not let up on existing networks." Do you use up more data on your smartphone or tablet? Tell us in the comments below.
