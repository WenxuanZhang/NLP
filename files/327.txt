 Tina Fey doesn't like Twitter. In fact, she thinks most Twitter users are downright boring. That's what the comedian said in a short video, answering a question from a fan who wanted to know if she used Twitter. "I have never used it," she said. "I do look at other people's twit of things sometimes." Why doesn't she use it? "I think you should have to get a license to use Twitter because most people are so fucking boring that they should shut up," she said.
