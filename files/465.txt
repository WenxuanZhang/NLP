A mysterious Japanese teaser site appeared Tuesday morning with silhouettes from the Final Fantasy universe and a date of Jan. 17. Fans were left to speculate on social media if the wordless webpage posted by publisher Square Enix was related to a particular game in the Final Fantasy franchise or perhaps a new product entirely. Most of the sprite-shaped silhouettes are recognizable to fans as characters from Final Fantasy VI, originally released in 1994, but a few of the characters could also be from other games.  There is also reason to believe the game is coming to iOS, since Jan. 17 falls on a Thursday, the weekly release date for new iOS games. Square Enix has also been active about releasing Final Fantasy games and other titles to iOS over the last year.  We're reached out to Square Enix, but until then we'll have to wait until Thursday to see this mystery revealed. What do you think the teaser image means? Let us know in the comments.
