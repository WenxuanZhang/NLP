When Congress was debating the Stop Online Piracy Act back in late 2011, a report alleged staff at the U.S. House of Representatives were downloading pirated content illegally — the exact practice SOPA was intended to fight.  Fast forward to today, and it seems House employees are still grabbing TV episodes and movies on the digital down-low. Computers in the House of Representatives have been used to download "dozens" of films and television shows, according to a report by ScanEye shared with U.S. News and World Report. ScanEye works by tracking IP addresses used to download files via BitTorrent. ScanEye matched IP addresses of downloaders with the House through use of IP-to-location finder MaxMind. BitTorrent is commonly used to pirate content but also used to share legitimate files. However, ScanEye's analysis shows that much of the content downloaded by IP addresses in the House are most likely protected by copyright law: Episodes of popular television shows Glee and Dexter and films such as Lawless and The Cabin in the Woods, for example.  There's even a DVD rip of Life of Pi — which won't be officially released until March 5 — listed in ScanEye's report. SEE ALSO: BitTorrent Surges to 100 Million Active Users
 US News' report notes it doesn't include "every Congressional office" — the Senate is notably absent — "so the number of illegal downloads may be higher." Mashable has reached out to ScanEye for data regarding the Senate's downloading practices. We will update this story with any response. ScanEye's report is embedded below. Does it surprise you that federal employees are allegedly pirating content? Share in the comments.
