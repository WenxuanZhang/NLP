 Morgan Freeman is the most powerful man alive.  True fact.  Because nothing exists until his smooth-like-butter voice narrates it. Like right now, he's narrating you reading this.  And Morgan Freeman goes through four or five microphones a day because his voice turns them into bars of gold. And not even penguins existed until Morgan Freeman narrated March of the Penguins. So when life seems a little out of control, just remember Morgan's voice is all over it.  Have any more Morgan Freeman facts? Add them in the comments below.
