In a memo titled "This Isn't the Petition Response You're Looking For," the Obama White House formally (and finally!) responded Friday to a petition asking to secure the resources to begin construction on a Death Star by 2016. Sorry, Dark Side supporters, but the administration's view is clear: it "does not support blowing up planets." As we, and the White House, know, the real cost of building a Death Star is so high it has 15 zeroes attached, and, for practicality's sake alone, that's one project that will not be getting the green light this year. But — that's not all! Cheekiness aside, the White House used this petition response as an opportunity to remind us of all the great space programs that are currently underway. There's the International Space Station, robots on Mars, telescopes discovering new planets, and prospects of manned missions to the Moon this decade — exciting times, no matter which side of the Force you're on. SEE ALSO: Mr. President, Build This Death Star
 The greatest lesson, though, comes at the close of the memo: "If you do pursue a career in a science, technology, engineering or math-related field, the Force will be with us! Remember, the Death Star's power to destroy a planet, or even a whole star system, is insignificant next to the power of the Force." Take heed, future Jedis of America, and get studying!
