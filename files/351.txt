 Toy Story, released in 1995, became an instant classic: Telling the story of a child's toys come to life, it was the first feature-length animated film. It set the bar extraordinarily high for producer Pixar, which has mostly been delivering blockbusters ever since. Toy Story pulled in nearly $362 million at the box office and was nominated for three Academy Awards.  But what if Toy Story wasn't animated, but instead shot in live-action with real toys and people? That's exactly what YouTube user "jonasonsMovies" did.  His project, Live-Action Toy Story, combines his own footage with the film's original audio, clocking in at one hour and 20 minutes. It has more than 83,000 views and made it to the front page of Reddit after a day online. Check Live-Action Toy Story out in all its real-life glory above. Would you watch the whole thing?
