 Interestingly, the iPad mini received a lukewarm reception when it first launched in China last month. Reports suggested that turnout for Apple's 7.9-inch tablet was minimal, and that lines were "nearly nonexistent" â€” even in high-traffic areas such as the company's Beijing-based flagship store.  Still, Apple products are wildly popular in China, with more than 2 million units of the iPhone 5 sold in the first weekend it launched there.  Company CEO Tim Cook has made it clear that Apple considers the Chinese market a priority.  "China is a very important market for us and customers there cannot wait to get their hands on Apple products," he said last month. The Wi-Fi and cellular-capable iPad mini and fourth-generation iPad start at $459 and $629, respectively (for the 16GB models).
