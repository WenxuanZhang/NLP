 Paging C-3PO: there's a job opening with your name on it. Robot Restaurant, in the Heilongjiang province of China, has a staff of 20 robots that cook, serve and entertain its guests. The restaurant opened in June 2012 and has since become a novelty spot in the province's capital.  The robot staff operates through tracks on the floor, which lead from the kitchen and down the aisles between tables. The menu includes dumplings and noodles and is prepared by the robots themselves. After a patron orders, a robot sings near the table while their food is being cooked.        The bots are between four and five feet tall and can display 10 different facial expressions.

 According to the Daily Mail, each machine can work for about five hours after a two-hour charge. But the staff doesn't come cheap: each one costs between $30,000 and $50,000, the Mail reported.  Other restaurants are experimenting with non-human staff as well. In San Francisco, a tech startup called Momentum Machines is hoping to launch a burger joint where all the cooking is done by robots. The company says the machines can crank out more than 360 hamburgers per hour.        Would you dine at a robot-run restaurant? Tell us what you think about it below.
