 After an initial period of reticence following the Newtown shootings, the National Rifle Association has come out with an acerbic web-only ad calling President Obama an "elitist hypocrite" because his kids attend a school with armed guards. "Are the President's kids more important than yours?" the ad asks. "Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their schools?" The NRA posited the idea of armed guards in schools on Dec. 21, a week after the tragic Newtown massacre. The ad comes as Obama plans to unveil a "package of concrete proposals" relating to gun violence on Wednesday.  What do you think? Is this an effective argument? Let us know in the comments.
