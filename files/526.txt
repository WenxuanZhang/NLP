 CES 2013 is already fading from memory, but what a ride it was. Thousands of companies and hundreds of thousands of visitors converged on the desert-dry town to ogle the latest gadgets and gizmos, hobnob with celebrities and reconnect with old friends and colleagues. It was like that for me. When I wasn't grabbing another drink of water or applying Chapstick to my lips, I was running from booth to booth, meeting to meeting and interview to interview to get the story. Highlights for me included the "I think I'm looking out a window" 4K ultra HD screens, 3D interfaces, touch-screen computers, surprise gaming platforms, Danny DeVito, Felicia Day, robots and Samsung's green lemonade. I could describe the story of CES 2013 in more detail or you could simply settle in for almost a minute to enjoy Mashable's supercut of our experience at CES 2013. It’s the best way to get at least the flavor of the massive technology event — without the chapped lips. Image by Mashable CES 2013 is already fading from memory, but what a ride it was.
