 It sounds like a great idea: A boot with retractable skis. It saves a lot of room in the car and takes less time to get on and off the slopes. Too bad the product — SkiBrogues — is a fake.  The concept is actually an ad for Hertz. If you click through to SkiBrogues' official-looking site, there's a Hertz banner ad showing weekly rental rates for ski destinations. And if you still want to buy a SkiBrogue? Sorry, they're sold out. Hertz isn't the first advertiser to create a product to generate interest for its primary offering. Applebee's last summer advertised an inflatable doll that was supposed to act as a decoy at work so you can grab lunch at the chain. That, however, was a real product, which sold briskly on Amazon.
