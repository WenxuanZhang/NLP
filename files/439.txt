 Get ready to meet the Long brothers â€” but be sure to have some tissue handy first.  Conner is 9-years-old, and Cayden is two years younger. Cayden was born with a debilitating condition called spastic cerebral palsy, but that hasn't stopped him from competing in triathlons (with a little help from his big brother). Cayden ditches his wheelchair for a cart or stroller, and Conner runs and bikes with Cayden in tow.  SEE ALSO: How Facebook Inspired One Woman's Incredible 'Tough Mudder'
 The brothers were selected as Sports Illustrated Kids' "Sportskids of the Year" for 2012, and the incredible video above shares their story. It ends with some of the sports world's biggest names applauding the Long family as they take the stage to accept the award. To call the video a tearjerker would be an understatement, and to call it inspiring wouldn't do it justice.  It was posted on the Special Olympics Arizona Facebook page late last week, and has already been shared more than 160,000 times.  So grab the tissue and check it out, and then let us what you think in the comments.  Thumbnail image via Special Olympics Arizona Facebook page
