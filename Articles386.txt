Story Updated 1/14/13 9:11 P.M. Television check-in app GetGlue is no longer merging with Viggle, the startup announced in a blog post Sunday. "The two companies remain friendly and think highly of each other," GetGlue said, adding that it is "moving forward as an independent company." In an unexpected move, Viggle acquired GetGlue for $73 million last November. The three-year-old startup, which describes itself as a "loyalty program for television," paid $25 million in cash and 48.3 million shares of stock for its competitor. Commentators expressed surprise at the acquisition, as Viggle is a much newer and lesser-known brand. GetGlue, which launched in 2007, boasts 3.2 million registered users, while Viggle has 1.2 million. One reason for the failed merger may be Viggle's precarious financial situation. The company reported a loss of $96.5 million on revenues of $1.7 million in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, according to a 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the time of the acquisition, Viggle president and COO Greg Consiglio told Mashable that the deal would only close if it successfully raised $60 million in debt financing.
