 "Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped, turned..."  Did you finish the lyric and then possibly the entire song? Congratulations, you probably watched a lot of television in the 1990s.  The catchy theme song to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air lives deep in the brains of pop culture junkies. That's why the creative folks at YouTube channel collectivecadenza decided to turn the tune upside down with help from Google Translate.

 Collectivecadenza ran the original lyrics through Google's magical translate machine to Mandarin Chinese and then back to English. Not satisfied with just one new version, they then dragged the song through five of the world's most used languages and created a fresh lyrical take on Will Smith's memorable ode to high-class living.
