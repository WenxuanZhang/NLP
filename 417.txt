The people have spoken. In a week of two big-name awards shows, the People's Choice Awards took home the title of biggest social star. The Jan. 9 CBS broadcast spurred 6.3 million comments on social media, beating out the Golden Globes.  Conversely, Sunday's film and television awards gala on NBC drew an impressive 3.8 million mentions — a 256% increase over last year's tally — with Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig's goofy presentation ranking as the most active moment of the night.  The most popular Golden Globe star on social media was Les Miserables' Anne Hathaway, followed by Jennifer Lawrence, Lena Dunham, Hugh Jackman and Claire Danes.
