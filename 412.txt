Samsung has sold more than 100 million Galaxy S devices, the company has announced.  Samsung reached this milestone in 2 years and 7 months after the launch of the original Samsung Galaxy S back in May 2010.  A big chunk of this success Samsung owes to its Galaxy S III, whose average daily sales are currently 190,000 units. All in all, the company sold 40 million Galaxy S III devices in 7 months. It took 20 months for its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S II, to reach that same milestone.  For comparison, Apple sold more than 250 million iPhones to date, but it had a big head start, given the first iPhone was launched in June 2007.
