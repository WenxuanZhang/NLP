 Move over, Skrillex. One bird is giving the dubstep king some competition with his fat, feathery beats.  In a 45-second YouTube video, Harvey the cockatiel tweets out heavy bass and energetic whirrs that wouldn't sound out of place in a club. In our humble opinion, the yellow-and-grey bird demonstrates such musical prowess that he could be an honorary nightingale.  Since going online earlier this week, the video has attracted more than 5.4 million views. What do you think of Harvey's skills? Are you aware of other musically inclined animals?
