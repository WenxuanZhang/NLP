LAS VEGAS — For Verizon, CES 2013 was all about innovation. The carrier didn't make any huge announcements at this year’s show, and instead took the opportunity to talk about how it is getting involved with other companies to create groundbreaking new products that will change how we interact with the world around us. Today at 12 p.m. PST / 3 p.m. EST,  Verizon is going to do a live tour of its CES booth using Livestream's Broadcaster, one of the devices actually on display in the carrier’s booth at CES. The device allows videographers to broadcast live video to the web directly from their camera. During the tour you’ll be able to see a technology for football helmets that can report exactly where a player was hit and with what force, Diebold's ATM of the future and get a closer look at Verizon's LTE Broadcast. We’ll have the whole broadcast below. While you watch, let us know in the comments what you think about the technology you see.
