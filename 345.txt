Six days after Megan Fox joined Twitter, the Transformers actress pondered why she's tapping away messages on the service. Then, abruptly, she stopped tweeting altogether. 5 days on Twitter and I have yet to discern it's purpose. #WhatIsThePoint ??? — Megan Fox (@meganfox) January 9, 2013 If you had the chance, how would you respond to Fox's question?  Fox has been silent on Twitter since sending this tweet on Jan. 9, but a nudge from some of Mashable's social media-savvy readers may be just what she needs to come back.  Her #WhatIsThePoint question garnered many answers from her nearly 275,000 followers: "you gotta start following people to get it. It’s about discovery, connection, etc." "The purpose is about to follow me baby. I love you!!!" "you keep followers informed of what you're up to in as much detail as you choose" "there's no such thing as a point on Twitter... but you if you want I'll explain you over dinner." "Seeking validation and pretending your thoughts have meaning. Duh." Fox had entered Twitter's birdcage Jan. 3 with a username she didn't want: "Every possible version of my name is already in use so for now my Twitter handle is [@MeganFox516]," she told her fans in a Facebook post announcing her new Twitter account.
