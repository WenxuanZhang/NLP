You can watch live here. The proposals are expected to include universal background checks, a renewed assault weapons ban and a prohibition on high-capacity magazines, according to CNN and others. Obama put Biden in charge of a task force on gun control following last month's shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Over the past several weeks, Biden has met with several key stakeholders including victims' groups, pro-gun groups such as the National Rifle Association, the entertainment and video games industries, and law enforcement officials.

 New York this week became the first state to pass stricter gun control laws in the aftermath of Sandy Hook, strengthening the state's assault weapons ban, reducing the number of bullets allowed in a single magazine and requiring mental health professionals to report persons they believe are a danger to themselves or others. The laws fortify New York's existing assault weapons ban, limit the number of bullets allowed in magazines and strengthen rules that govern the mentally ill, which includes a requirement to report potentially harmful behavior. New York also authorized the creation of a statewide firearms database. Photo courtesy of Flickr, Pete Souza/The White House
