Late Thursday, a report from the Shanghai Evening News suggested Apple would not be producing a less expensive iPhone despite reports to the contrary. That story, and what happened after its publication, is shaping up to be one of the most bizarre technology stories in recent memory. According to the report, Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller stated that his company would not be developing "cheap smartphones." Based on those comments, Reuters ran an article with the headline, "Apple exec dismisses iPhone as a market share grab — report." On Friday, Reuter pulled their original story after "substantial changes to its content" were made to the Shanghai Evening News report. In doing so, Reuters said "no replacement story will be issued." AppAdvice, and others, have no idea what "substantial changes" were made to that first story. All that remains of it is the unedited version hosted at jfdaily.com. It was clear on Thursday that many news outlets were concerned as to the accuracy of the Shanghai Evening News report. After all, its content went against reporting done earlier in the week by the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg that said a less expensive iPhone was coming. Although The Next Web received confirmation from Apple that the comments attributed to Schiller were correct. This latest development only adds some more confusion to the situation. Our best bet is that Schiller’s comments were correct, but perhaps taken out of context. Having read those comments in print, Apple likely sounded the alarm, which leads us to where we are at this moment: confusion. Image courtesy of Flickr, yum9me
