China has added 51 million new internet users in the last year, the Associated Press reports citing data from the China Internet Network Information Center. Compared to 2011, China's internet user population rose 10 percent, bringing the total number to 564 million. That's more than the entire population of Russia and the U.S. combined.  The increase is largely due to a surge in mobile web surfing. The number of Chinese web surfers who access the internet from mobile phones, tablets and other wireless devices, rose 18.1 percent in 2012 to 420 million.  China's huge web usage growth comes despite the government's measures to prevent access to a large number of online services. The world's largest online social networks — Facebook, Google Plus and Twitter — have been completely blocked in China for years.
