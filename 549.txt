 If you thought John McAfee’s recent international run from the authorities sounded like something out of the movies, you’re not alone. Warner Brothers has bought the rights to a Wired magazine article documenting the events.  When McAfee’s neighbor in Belize was killed in November, he went on the run, claiming that authorities in the country were trying to kill him. After a lengthy and unusual series of events, McAfee was eventually found in Guatemala where he faked a heart attack and was later deported to the United States. McAfee is best known for his computer anti-virus software. While Warner Brothers has bought the rights to the story, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it will make a film. For that, we’ll just have to wait and see. Would you go see a film documenting McAfee’s exploits? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.
