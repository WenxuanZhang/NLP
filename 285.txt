 Actor Marlon Wayans, whose comedy-horror flick A Haunted House landed in theaters Friday, gets inspiration for his Twitter missives in the darnedest places â€” like the bathroom.  "My greatest thoughts are when I'm on the toilet. And especially the spiritual shit when I'm just like 'Yo, make sure if you want to lead, never be a follower,'" he says in the above clip from the Shorty Awards. "See how that sounds? That comes from sh*tting." Wayans (@MARLONLWAYANS on Twitter) also reveals his Twitter pet peeve and announces he's a new judge for the Shorty Awards, an annual crowdsourced contest that honors social media professionals, agencies, brands, celebrities, comedians and more.
