LAS VEGAS – Toshiba is showing off at CES a prototype of an OLED smart watch that knows its owner by his or her pulse. An embedded ECG sensor in the rear of the watch lets it recognize its owner’s unique pulse patterns, and will shut down the watch’s smart functions if an impostor tries to put it on.  Able to connect to both iPhones and Android devices, the watch displays alerts for incoming calls, emails, and calendar events. Its display can be used for navigation, or to display the latest news and weather information. The watch’s high-resolution OLED display has sensors built-in that optimize for brightness and viewing angle, so you’ll always be able to see what’s on the screen. Currently in prototype form, the smart watch is just a glimpse at the kind of tech that we could see coming to our wrists in the future. Several other smart watch makers were on hand at this year’s CES, including I’m watch and Kickstarter-favorite Pebble.
