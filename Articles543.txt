We've all seen that Apple Maps is a far cry from perfect, but the Wall Street Journal's Kabul bureau chief may have just discovered some of its most amusing glitches while browsing on his iPad. Yaroslav Trofimov discovered a street named "Bad Monkey" and another named "MoJo Way." After discovering these unlikely streets on Apple Maps, he shared his findings to Twitter, UN Dispatch reports.  So is one of #Kabul 's main streets really called Bad Monkey, as the new Apple Maps on my iPad claim?#TooGoodToBeTrue twitter.com/yarotrof/statu…  The street behind the #Kabul Serena, meanwhile, has been appropriately renamed MoJo Way by #Apple #Maps... #fail twitter.com/yarotrof/statu… But how did these streets achieve these misnomers? Apple copied old maps from crowdsourced and edited mapping platform OpenStreetMap without fully fact checking street names.  The maps copied by Apple are some of the earliest created by a group of Afghan university students. The students assigned spoof names to nameless or disputed streets. Though corrections have since been made to OpenStreetMaps, the Apple maps inherited the initial errors. "The issue is that Apple took an old snapshot of the OpenStreetMap data and hasn’t updated it since, so things like 'personal' street names are in there, even if they have been fixed since," Kate Chapman, Indonesia-based director of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, told UN Dispatch. "The fact that they don’t update the data shows that the incentive for people to improve the map just isn’t going to be there." At press time, you could still find Bad Monkey, MoJo Way, and even "Hillbilly Hameed" in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. Seems like Apple isn't making any quick effort to correct Maps' faux pas in areas with low iPhone and iPad penetration.
