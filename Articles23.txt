On her first day back to work following a concussion and blood clot, Hillary Clinton's coworkers gave her a bit of a gag gift â€” a football helmet. Clinton, 65, was presented with the helmet, along with a matching jersey, during a morning meeting. Both sport official State Department insignia.  The Secretary of State was away from Washington for about a month after suffering a stomach virus then a concussion which led to a blood clot near her brain. Clinton was hospitalized for three days at New York-Presbyterian Hospital Columbia when doctors first discovered the clot on Dec. 30.
