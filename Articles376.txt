 Delta Airlines' new iPad app has a cool feature that will help pass the time on long flights: A "glass bottom jet" setting that lets you see exactly where you're flying and how fast. The feature offers a view of the plane flying over the map, replete with the shadow that the aircraft is projecting. The map also calls out landmarks and messages from your social networks. If a Facebook friend, for instance, has checked in to somewhere you're flying over, you'll see it. The Fly Delta for the iPad app has other features as well, including destination guides, flight checkin and a "What's Next" feature to help make post-flight plans. An updated version of Delta's iPhone app also includes Passbook-based ticketing. AKQA developed the app.  In a press release explaining the app, Delta notes that Fly Delta for iPad is part of a $140 million technology investment in the company. Delta currently has more than 800 planes equipped with wi-fi.
