 Parallel parking is no easy feat, let alone doing it in New York City. Anyone who's tried to park in Manhattan can attest to the impossibly narrow lanes and no-nonsense pedestrians.  Design firm Pentagram is trying to make the ordeal a little less stressful by creating clearer parking signs. Taking a cue from Twitter, the 6,300 new signs give drivers information in no more than 140 characters.  Since every second counts in a New York minute, the makeover is intended to clarify on-street parking regulations by making signs easier to understand. The change reduces information on the signs by nearly 50% with messages no longer than a tweet.  SEE ALSO: Listen to Coldplay if You Want to Stay Safe on the Road, Study Says
 "You shouldn't need a Ph.D. in parking signage to understand where you are allowed to leave your car in New York," said Council Member Garodnick in a statement from the cityâ€™s Department of Transportation.  What are your thoughts on the redesign? Do you think Twitter-sized parking signs can change driving habits? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.
