Chromebox, Samsung's Chrome OS-based mini PC, has been criticized for not packing enough power for its price. Now, it looks like Samsung is responding with a new version of Chromebox that has a much faster processor.  Instead of the lowly Celeron processor, the new Chromebox has a 2.5GHz dual-core Intel i5 processor. Its other specifications are identical to the old model: 4GB of memory and a 16GB SSD. The device, named XE300M22-A01US, is available through multiple retailers.  Price-wise, the Chromebox has gone up a little. The latest version costs upwards of $405, depending on the retailer, whereas its predecessor retails for $329.  While we welcome this increase in processing power, the fact that it comes with a significantly higher price tag makes us wonder whether the new Chromebox is worth purchasing.  Would you buy it?
