 LAS VEGAS –- Sony announced Monday the Xperia Z, its new flagship smartphone. Powered by Android, the phone has a quad-core Snapdragon S4 processor, 1080p display, and a 13-megapixel built-in camera. Designed with durability in mind, Sony used tempered glass on the front and back of the phone, as well as an anti-shatter film. The phone is dust and water-resistant — IP55 and IP57, specifically — and can survive everything from a conference call in the rain to an accidental dunk in your toilet. We had the opportunity to spend a little time with the Xperia Z this week at CES. Check out a walk-through of the phone and its features in the video above.
