 Taking medications is often an inevitable part of life for the elderly and those with long-term illnesses. It can be pretty confusing when you have different pills to swallow at multiple times of the day. MedFolio is designed to simplify this process.  The MedFolio Electronic Pillbox offers an organized way to take your medications, with times and days sectioned in each container. Not only can you track your medication one week in advance, but each section also features an LED light that glows when you need to take the pills. The light goes off once the related segment has been removed.   When it's time to take your medication, the light will flash and send audio alarms via email or text message. You can also place all your medications in a list so that they are easy to identify. MedFolio recently added another component to its Electronic PillBox â€” a wireless version. While the original pillbox will still be available for $248, MedFolio now offers an electronic pillbox that has Wi-Fi capabilities (price is not yet available).  This feature is great for connected family members who want to play a more active part in their parent's healthcare. The box will sync information about the user's medication journey to a secure server, so a family member can check whether or not their loved ones are actually adhering to their medication list.
