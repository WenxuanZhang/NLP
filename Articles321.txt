LAS VEGAS – The CES show floor was home to several GPS trackers this year. One of the most interesting was I’m Here, a tracker developed by the same company that created an Android smart watch called I’m Watch. Unveiled during the company’s CES press conference, I’m Here is a pint-sized tracker designed to help you keep up with everything from your suitcase to your kindergartener. The tracker works using the same technology found in cell phones. Users can find out where the device is located — whether it's in a bag or tied to a shoe — whenever they want.  If, for example, you arrive at your destination without your bag, simply ping the device to find out where it is. The I’m Here’s location is shown on a map in an accompanying app for the device. I’m Here has a high up-front cost — around $160 — but after its initial purchase, you can locate the device 200 times for free. Each additional search after the initial 200 will cost $0.05. The device can be used in any country around the world for the same price. Trakdot, a competing GPS tracker specifically for suitcases and bags, is expected to be available in March of this year for a suggested retail price of $49.95. Activating that device will cost an additional $8.99, plus an annual service fee of $12.99. Whereas Trakdot is a fairly large device, however, I’m Here is both small and colorful, making it ideal for tracking kids (by tying the device onto their shoe, for example). It's also great for finding lost valuables such as house keys or a pet.  What do you think about using devices such as I’m Here to track your kids and luggage? Let us know your thoughts in the comments. Powerful yet fun DIY robotics for adults and children. This update moves the control/interactions to your favorite mobile devices. -- Lance Ulanoff, Mashable Editor-in-Chief Read more about the Lego Mindstorms EV3 here.
