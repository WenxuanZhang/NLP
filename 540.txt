Hey, you. Yes, you, smiling like a homecoming queen. You're too perky — grouch it up a little, mmkay? Grumpy Cat can lend a paw. No, the Internet's most famous feline Scrooge won't make an appearance at your family pancake breakfast, but you could see her crabby face with every sip of coffee. Just pick up a hand-painted Grumpy Cat mug.  SEE ALSO: Grumpy Cat Tattoo Could Impress Even the Crankiest Kitty
 That's right; you can now meow "Good riddance!" to regular cat-themed home decor. Etsy merchants, Reddit users and even Grumpy Cat's real life owners have plastered — litter-ally, in some cases — the meme kitty's face to an assortment of products. Of course, the real Grumpy Cat would hate every plush toy and nipple pasty pictured below, but she doesn't have a credit card anyway.
