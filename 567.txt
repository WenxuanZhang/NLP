 Ever wonder what it would be like to be broken up with by Samuel L. Jackson? It would hurt, but it would sound great, as witnessed by Jackson's on-air cover of Taylor Swift's "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together."  Jackson has more edge than Swift (who doesn't?), but his voice is just so damn intoxicating â€” It's like hot fudge telling you to get lost.  SEE ALSO: Samuel L. Jackson Might Have Dropped the F-Bomb on SNL
 And Sammy's not afraid to cuss you out either. He really wants you to leave him alone.  T-Swift, might we recommend a collaboration for your next single? Or maybe just date Jackson; We'd love to hear that break-up song.  Photo courtesy of Flickr, Mike Disharoon.
