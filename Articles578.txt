 For most people, massage appointments are a luxury â€” a tradeoff between time and money, and relaxation. But one company aims to make massages more accessible by using a robot.  The WheeMe is a personal pint-sized massage therapist that "massages and caresses" as it rolls across your body, according to the device's official website. Created by DreamBots, the WheeMe uses "tilt sensor technology" to steer itself on a surface without falling off or losing its grip. The robotic masseur runs on three AA batteries, and functions autonomously; just place it on your body to get started. At less than a pound heavy, the WheeMee isn't capable of giving deep tissue massages, but DreamBots does promise users a "nice gentle feeling." Check out the video, above, for more. Would the WheeMee replace your visits to the massage therapist? Tell us in the comments below.
